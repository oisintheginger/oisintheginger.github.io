                            <p>Press Rekord is a 2D action-adventure game set in a curious underground world filled with monsters both friendly and nefarious. The game follows the story of Kat, an up-and-coming urban explorer live streamer, who finds herself in a mysterious subterranean town in an abandoned subway station, filled with bright neon lights and even more colourful characters. While only being a short demo of a potential game, Press Rekord has a lot of content to mess around with, and features cool tools and systems for the player to interact with. Players can follow 'quests' and use a map tool to find their way through the labyrinthine tunnels outside of the main town. Kat can also perform different types of attacks.</p>
                            <p>The short demo was created by a team of students for their final year project for the Bachelor of Arts in Game Design Program at TUDublin. Team Members included Megan Grant, Michael Ward, Aaron Kennedy, Tabeeb Choudhury, and me as the main programmer. It was a difficult and unprecedented time for students in recent years, as it was the year in which COVID 19 forced the world into isolation. We adapted to the new challenge and were able to complete the project. </p>
                            <p>The features I am most proud of was my implementation of the quest systems, the foundations of the combat system, the map and user interfaces including the dialogue system, and my favourite contribution, the final boss encounter. </p>
                            <p>The team and I learned a lot through our struggles, and we gained experience and skill both in our technical abilities, but also our interpersonal communication and finding internal motivation to keep going even when the world was struggling under the weight of the pandemic.</p>

                            <p>The Python Command Line Library project was a small final project for the Object-Oriented Programming module for the Fundamentals of Computing pre-Masters course at TUDublin. It was a small-scale assignment and were given a couple of options as to what we wished to create. My initial intention was to create a visual application using buttons using TKinter and other modules, however, due to time constraints with other assignments, I was unable to justify the extra time towards it.</p>
                            <p>The project consists of a command line interface that allows users to rent books and return them, as well as signing members up to the virtual 'library'. It is a simple program, but it serves to demonstrate my understanding of the fundamentals of programming in Python.</p>
                            <p>Although I had previous experience with other languages such as C# for Unity, and C++ as I was introducing myself to graphics programming, it was fun to be introduced to another language and I found it quite easy to pick up. I feel more inspired to try my hand at other languages now and to find cool projects to work on.</p>
