                            <p>After the completion of the bachelor's degree in game design, I enrolled in this preparatory course as a stepping-stone to entering a Masters program in Computer Science. While the bachelor's degree provided the environment to get a general exposure to programming and technology, it did not provide the necessary fundamentals to progress directly into a masters program for computer science. </p>
                            <p>This course provided the necessary foundations to see that goal to fruition. The program served as a crash course in the fundamentals of computing, including introductions to SQL and Relational Database Design, Computer Architecture and Networking, Python and Systems Design, and the basics of Web Design, to which this website owes its existence to. While the content was foundational and very high-level, the timeline of the course was intensive, with assignments and classes requiring the full commitment of my fellow students and myself. </p>
                            <p>I cannot say enough about how much the course has done for me in both expanding my career and educational prospects, but also in its contribution towards building my confidence in my own abilities, and the friends that I have made along the way.</p>

                            <p>In 2017 I entered my Game Design undergraduate program at TUDublin. Over the next four years, not only did I learn skills such as programming, production, presentations, and design, but I expanded my interests and discovered aspects of myself that I did not know were there. I was diligent in my studies and always strived to create excellent projects and demonstrate my skill in designing and developing games.</p>
                            <p>Course assessment was near-exclusively project-based, encouraging students to demonstrate creativity and self-directed learning to achieve project goals and criteria. Most assignments were created using the Unity engine, where over time we increased in skill in using the engine to create fun and interesting games. The culmination of the program was the final year assignment, which is detailed on the portfolio page.</p>
